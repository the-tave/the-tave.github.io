  abstract = {Personality changes across the lifespan, primarily driven by environmental factors. However, environmental influences on personality, such as those related to life events, have been unsystematic, inconsistent, and difficult to replicate. One explanation for the mixed body of evidence may be that some personality characteristics are more prone to environmental changes than others. In the present study, we analyzed self- and informant reports across three assessment waves in 3150 individuals (14--91~years, 62\% female) to compare the stability and changeability of broad HEXACO trait dimensions (e.g., Emotionality and Openness) and core motives (e.g., Growth and Self-Protection) using latent variable and growth-curve modeling. We then compared both constructs in their susceptibility to 21 life-event categories using latent change modeling. We found marginal differences in the changeability of broad trait dimensions and core motives. While there were no consistent differences in event effects on change in both constructs, effects on the probability of experiencing events were significantly larger for core motives than for broad traits. The results provide no evidence for the hypotheses that core motives are more changeable and environmentally malleable than broad traits. In contrast, our results indicate selection effects rather than event effects and that motives primarily drive life experiences.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Do Core Motivation-Specific Characteristics Differ from Broad Personality Trait Characteristics in their Changeability and Susceptibility to Life Experiences?: Personality characteristics changes across the lifespan, primarily driven by environmental factors. However, environmental influences on personality characteristics, such as those related to life events and changes in life circumstances, have been unsystematic, inconsistent, and difficult to replicate. One explanation for the inconcistency in the literature may be that some personality characteristics, such as those that primarily describe the individual as motivated agent, are more prone to environmental changes than other characteristics, such as those that primarily describe the individual as social actor. In the present study, we analyzed self- and informant reports on representative sets of these two different personality characteristics across three assessment waves in 3150 individuals (14--91~years, 62\% female). We compared the stability and changeability of broad HEXACO trait dimensions (e.g., Honesty Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness) and core motives (e.g., Growth, Self-Enhancement, Universal and Communal Self-Transcendence, Stimulation, and Self-Protection) using latent variable and growth-curve modeling. We then compared both constructs in their susceptibility to 21 life-event categories using latent change modeling. We found marginal differences in the changeability of the broad HEXACO trait dimensions and the six core motives. While there were no consistent differences in event effects on change in both HEXACO traits and core motives, effects on the probability of experiencing events were significantly larger for core motives than for HEXACO traits. The results provide no evidence for the hypotheses that core motives are more changeable and environmentally malleable than broad traits. In contrast, our results indicate selection effects rather than event effects and that core motives primarily drive life experiences.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study examines the external communication of the German healthcare system regarding climate change up until June 2024, utilizing a systematic quantitative content analysis. The study analyses websites, position papers, press releases, and social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and ``X''/Twitter) from 42 organizations across various sectors of the healthcare system (a total of 54 organizations analyzed). Content categories were developed based on a review of topic-specific literature. Only a few contributions ({$<$}10 press releases/year) prior to 2018 were identified. Since 2018, there has been a highly significant increase and diversification in external communication, differentiated by communication channels and thematic areas. Overall, a relatively homogeneous communication pattern among the various sectors is evident. The contributions primarily address sector-specific climate adaptation and mitigation measures (49\% of cases), followed by measures aimed at individuals (19\%) and moderate calls for Enhanced climate policy measures (15\%). The multiple cited behavioral economic communication approaches linking climate- and health-protective behaviors were identifiable in only 2.5\% of cases; similarly, tipping points in ecosystems were communicated only seldom (0.3\%).},

  abstract = {With Internet-based research, non-response such as lack of responses to particular items and dropout have become interesting dependent variables due to highly voluntary participation and large numbers of participants (Reips, 2000, 2002b). In this article, we develop and discuss the methodology of using and analyzing dropout in Internet-based research, and we present dropR, an R package and web service (web application) to analyze and visualize dropout. The web app was written in R using Shiny, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Among other features, dropR turns input from datasets into accessible and publication-ready visual displays of dropout curves. It calculates parameters relevant to dropout analysis, such as chi-square values and odds ratios for points of difference, initial drop, and percent remaining in stable states. It provides Kaplan--Meier survival statistics and tests survival curve differences. With automated inferential components, it identifies critical points in dropout and critical differences between dropout curves for different experimental conditions (Kolmogorov--Smirnov and rho-family statistics) and produces related statistical copy. Requiring no programming knowledge, dropR is provided as a free web application at https://dropr.euand for programmers as an R package~(under a cost free general public license, GPL-3, https://cran.r-project.org/web/licenses/GPL-3) from researchers for researchers.

  abstract = {Numbers are associated with space, but it is unclear how flexible these associations are. We investigated whether the SNARC effect (Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes; Dehaene et al. 1993 J. Exp. Psychol. 122, 371--396. (doi:10.1037/0096-3445.122.3.371); i.e. faster responses to small/large number magnitude with the left/right hand, respectively) is fully flexible (depending only on relative magnitude within a stimulus set) or not (depending on absolute magnitude as well). Evidence for relative-magnitude dependency came from studies observing that numbers 4 and 5 were associated with the right in a 0--5 range but with the left in a 4--9 range (Dehaene et al. 1993; Fias et al. 1996 Math. Cogn. 2, 95--110 (doi:10.1080/135467996387552). Within this Registered Report, we conducted two online experiments running Bayesian analyses with optional recruitment stopping at moderate evidence (BF10 above 3 or below 1/3). Experiment 1 (n = 200) replicated relative-magnitude dependency using the original stimuli. However, Experiment 2 (n = 300) additionally demonstrated absolute-magnitude dependency, while considering recent advances in SNARC research using 1--5 excluding 3 and 4--8 excluding 6. In contrast to the frequently perpetuated notion of fully flexible Spatial-Numerical Associations, some fixed relation to absolute magnitude prevails. These findings have important consequences for understanding how Spatial-Numerical Associations might support numerical processing.},
