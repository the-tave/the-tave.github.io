Here you can find all the projects that I am currently working on.
Most of them are R-based and my focus lies in making solid statistics and psychological methods available to everyone.
If you happen to find a mistake somewhere, have ideas for further features or just want to gush about the beauty of Open Code don't hesitate to contact me!
