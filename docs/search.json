Everyone from the admin staff e.g., is so nice and helpful which is not always a given in my experience. So I can’t really name just one resource, it’s really a combination. In our department specifically, we have a lovely departmental advisor who is always there for questions, so knowing that has been a huge help!\nWhen it comes to more academic support, I love the Get S*** Done Days organized by the Doctoral Researcher Council as well as collaborative writing times. Especially when working on writing a paper and prioritizing focused work, it is wonderful to have peers around you, concentrated and working on their own projects for motivation and moral support!"
