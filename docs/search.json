    "text": "Challenges (or What nobody tells you about doing your PhD)\nWhat has been the biggest challenge during your PhD, and how did you overcome it?\nApart from the fact that you have to be self-sufficient and organized, I think one of the biggest challenges for me has been working in a big research team with many members who have different priorities and needs. Communication is key in any team, but coordinating meetings with international team members who maybe live in different time zones is a bit tough. In these situations it is really great to be able to talk to and connect with other PhD students! Often times, others know the struggle and can give some advice. If not, they will probably still listen to you rant."

Everyone from the admin staff is so nice and helpful which is not always a given in my experience. So I can’t name one single resource, it’s really a combination. In our department specifically, we have a lovely departmental advisor who is always there for questions, so that has been a huge help!\nWhen it comes to more academic support, I love the Get S*** Done Days organized by the Doctoral Researcher Council as well as collaborative writing times. Especially when working on writing a paper and prioritizing focused work, it is wonderful to have peers around you, concentrated and working on their own projects for motivation and moral support!"

If it were a magic wish, I would probably ask for infinite hours in my supervisor’s day to ask more questions, have more meetings and get more input!\nRealistically, it would be amazing to attend more international conferences and generally do more networking across the globe. Connecting with other researchers is always fun and just crucial for relevant research in my opinion."
